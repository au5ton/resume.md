# resume.md

I wrote my resume in Markdown.

## Building

- `npm install -g markdown-pdf@8.1.1`
- `./build.sh`
- Output found at: Resume.pdf

## Warnings
- markdown-pdf is inconsistent between versions.
    - I've found 8.1.1 to consistently support CSS
    - I've found 8.1.1 to be inconsistent between platforms (macOS/Windows)
    - Just go ahead and build on macOS
